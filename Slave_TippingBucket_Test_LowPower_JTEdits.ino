This sketch is firmware to be loaded onto a slave micro-controller and used for
counting pulse events, specifically those from a tipping bucket rain gauge

This sketch turns the device into a tip counter which is also an I2C slave,
every time a tip occours, the device counts it, then when the master device
reads from the slave device, it returns the number of tips since the last time
the salve was read in the form of an unsigned int

An example master code can be found at
https://github.com/EnviroDIY/TippingBucketRainCounter/blob/master/Master_Test/Master_Test.ino

Required connections are:
Pin (3 by default) -> Tipping bucket line A
Pin_Low (4 by default) -> Tipping bucket line B
SCL -> Master device SCL
SDA -> Master device SDA
Power -> External power (varies by device)
